      She'd take the world off my shoulders
    <br>
      If it was ever hard to move
    <br>
      She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
    <br>
      When I was living in the blue
    <br>
      Why then, if she's so perfect
    <br>
      Do I still wish that it was you?
    <br>
      Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
    <br>
      So what can I do? (Ooh)
    <br>
    <br>
      When you're out of sight
    <br>
      In my mind
    <br>
    <br>
      'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
    <br>
      And that's where I find a glimpse of us
    <br>
      And I try to fall for her touch
    <br>
      But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
    <br>
      Said I'm fine and said I moved on
    <br>
      I'm only here passing time in her arms
    <br>
      Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us
