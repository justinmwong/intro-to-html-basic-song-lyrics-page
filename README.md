# intro-to-html-basic-song-lyrics-page
This is a basic version of a song lyric page for my IT class. The goal was to get started with HTML. There was no CSS styling or any JavaScript used in this case. The next assignment involved using CSS to style the song lyric page, which I will upload as a separate project. Created on Glitch.
